## Ethics, Fairness, Responsibility, and Privacy in Data Science (DATA 25900). Spring 2021

This course takes a technical approach to exploring societal issues of ethics, fairness, responsibility, and privacy related to the collection, use, and generalization of data. The course introduces fundamental techniques related to data acquisition, data cleaning, sampling, statistical modeling, experimental design, feature engineering, and modeling with machine learning. It then explores the problems that arise in different ways of performing those tasks, the fairness and bias of machine learning models, data visualizations, and user interfaces. In addition, the course covers anonymization and deanonymization, conceptions of privacy from a number of perspectives (statistical, legal, and philosophical), and compliance with contractual or legal requirements around data. The course concludes by discussing current controversies around the use and misuse of data. Through both programming assignments and discussions, students who complete the course will learn how to design systems that are inclusive and respectful of all data subjects.

### Schedule

The schedule [is available here](schedule.md).

The schedule includes lecture topics, readings, as well as the dates where all assignments will be released and due. Make sure to check the schedule often, as I expect there will be some adjustments to the dates throughout the quarter.

### Grading

- **Programming Assignments (30%, 6% each).** The programming assignments are an important component of your grade. You can find the tentative release dates in the schedule. You can work on these assignments in pairs.
- **Programming Assignments Quiz (5%)** A quiz towards the end of the quarter with questions about the programming assignments. This will be easy if you've done the work on the programming assignments throughout the quarter.
- **Reading Responses (8. 2% each. Total 16%)** We will assign readings each week. At the end of the week we will ask a question about the readings and ask you to provide a brief answer.
- **Individual Project (35%)** A big component of your grade. You will engage in a quarter-long individual project. You will deliver a short report and present your work to the class during the two final sessions.
- **Responsibility/Ethics/Privacy Issue Report (10%)** In addition to the above, you will deliver a short (maximum 450 words) report where you detail an issue related to the topics covered in class throughout the quarter. In particular, the report should indicate the problem you've identified. Some valid topics include news in the media, books, articles, and others. If you are unsure about the topic, make sure you reach out to the instructor soon in the quarter to confirm. In addition to pinpointing the problem, this report should explain clearly why it's a problem, and what are some fixes or measures that one could take to ameliorate or avoid this issue in the future. 
- **Class Participation (4%).** *A small part of your grade comes from participation. If your grade ends up on a border between two grades (e.g. B+ and A-) this can sway your grade. Participation can be earned in several ways listed below. Doing well in 2 categories will get you 3%. Excelling in 1 category will you 3% (e.g. one of the most active students in answering questions on Ed). Doing well in 1 category will get you 1~2%. Showing up and listening to every discussion, watching the videos, and asking for help with HW on Ed or OH **does not** count as participation. ***If** you are in a very different timezone (eg Asia/Pacific Islands) and cannot make it to the discussion, being active at TA OH can substitute being active in the discussion.* 

### Academic Integrity Policy

The University of Chicago has formal policies related to academic honesty and plagiarism, as described by the university broadly and the college specifically. We abide by these standards in this course. Depending on the severity of the offense, you risk being dismissed altogether from the course. All cases will be referred to the Dean of Students office, which may impose further penalties, including suspension and expulsion. If you have any question about whether some activity would constitute cheating, please feel free to ask. In addition, we expect all students to treat everyone else in the course with respect, following the norms of proper behavior by members of the University of Chicago community. 

Student interactions are an important and useful means to master course material. We recommend that you discuss the material in this class with other students. While it is acceptable to discuss assignments in general terms, it is not acceptable to turn in someone else's writing or code (or fragments thereof) as your own. When the time comes to write down your answer, you should write it down yourself from your own understanding. Moreover, you should cite any material discussions or written sources, e.g., "Note: I discussed this exercise with Jane Smith." If one student "helps" another by giving them a copy of their assignment, only to have that other student copy it and turn it in, both students are culpable. If you have any questions about what is or is not proper academic conduct, please ask an instructor. (This description of academic honesty is derived in part from those of Stuart Kurtz and John Reppy).
